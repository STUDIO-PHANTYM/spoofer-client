# Overview
The *Spoofer Client* module works with the server-sided *Spoofer* to create as testing environment on Roblox. It allows clients to interact while the server interprets all their actions, requests, and events as coming from an assigned user ID, enabling easy simulation of different user perspectives.

# Key Features
- **User ID Emulation**: Allows clients to view and interact with the game as if they were another user, providing insights into various perspectives.
- **Permission Simulation**: Test role-based access and restrictions by emulating permissions tied to specific user roles.
- **Bug Testing**: Reproduce and troubleshoot user-reported issues by assuming their exact ID temporarily.
- **DataStore Testing**: Test data handling and user-specific data scenarios by interacting as different user IDs.
